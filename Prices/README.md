Shopping Options

A customer wants to buy a pair of jeans, a pair of shoes, a skirt, and a top but has a limited budget in dollar.
Given differente pricing options for each product, determine how many options our customer has to buy 1 of each product. You cannot spend more money than the budgeted amount.

Example

priceOfJean = [2, 3]
priceOfShoes = [4]
priceOfskirts = [2, 3]
priceofTops = [1, 2]
budgeted = 10

The customer must buy shoes for 4 dollars since there is only one option.
This levaes 6 dollars to spend on the other 3 item.
Combinations of prices paid for jeans, skirts, and tops respectively that add up 6 dollars or less are [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1]. [3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1].
There are 4 aways the customer can purchase all 4 items.
